Every floor is connected to the next one and it takes Baam n years to pass the test of the nth floor and move on to the n+1th floor.

To take a shortcut, one also has to take a test. You want Baam to become a Ranker as soon as possible, so you must find the fastest way to reach the last explored floor of The Tower.
Once Baam arrives on a floor, he can go back to any lower floor to take a shortcut,
and the amount of time taken to move between floors is negligible compared to the amount of time that Baam needs to pass a test.

Now, you may not understand everything written here, but don't worry; for now, you just need to discover how long it will take Baam to become a Ranker if he follows the optimum path in The Tower.

Input

The first line will contain an integer C, the number of cases for our problem.
Each case consists of a line with two integers F and S, the last explored floor of The Tower and the number of shortcuts.
A set of S lines with three integers A, B and Y follows, each indicating a shortcut from floor A to floor B with a test that takes Baam Y years to pass.

Output

For each case, a line starting with "Case #x: " followed by the years it will take Baam to become a Ranker. Every line is followed by a new line character.

In Case 1, there are only two floors with no shortcuts. The only path is (1 → 2), taking 1 year.
In Case 2, (1 → 2 → 3 → 4), (1 → 3 → 4) and (1 → 2 → 4) take 6 years.
In Case 3, the fastest path is (1 → 2 → 3 → 5 → 8 → 9), taking 19 years. Note that Baam will need to go down to the 4th floor after arriving at the 5th in order to take the shortcut (4 → 8).
In Case 4, the fastest path takes 16 years.
